# astrometry_prior
Demonstrates how to fit an astrometry prior to a groundbased optical
mosaic camera.

The notebook in the `notebooks/ztf` subdirectory shows how to fit a global
model to data from a mosaic camera, in this case the Zwicky Transient Facility
camera. This example uses public ZTF data.

For reference, see David Shupe's SciPy 2018 
[proceedings paper](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2018/david_shupe.html) 
and [talk](https://youtu.be/2GTLkH5sfJc) where the method of computing 
a prior for ZTF was described.
